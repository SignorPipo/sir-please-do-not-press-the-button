To Do:

  - create simple scene with the gentle man, the button and the hand
  - the button is a physx collision and u have a trigger on bot your hand and the gentle man hand
	- if it overlaps the earth explode
  - add a basic game flow so that u have a start (with fade) and end screen (explosion) and a win state (earth view for longer but then u hear the click and explodes)
	- it restarts after that
  - add close detection when facing the gentle man and show a cube for now just as a placeholder
  - add the hand going down over time with a multiplier
	- the hand is always going no matter what, u can just make it go slower or faster by picking the right/wrong answer
  - hide the webxr hands when on the earth view + activate fly
  - tilt the character on y if no webxr when eart explode
