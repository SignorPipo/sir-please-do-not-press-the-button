To Do:

  - tilt the character on y if no webxr when earth explode
  - add pulse when pressing buttons
  - the explode button hand gpoing down could be using physx not kinematic, no gravity , with a down linea velocity always set at frame time
	- this way u can block it with your hand or push it up again
	- at some point, if u block it for too long, he will say he has another secret explode button anyway
	- lock the hand on the y axis and maybe out an invisible block think to avoid being able to push it up infinetely (even though that may not be needed since u are not infinetely tall
	- he could also increase the multiplier speed because u are making him pissed cause of this
  - add a way to click the button with the mouse outside VR
  - add that if the pose is invalid the hands should disappear
  
  
Done:
  
  - create simple scene with the gentle man, the button and the hand
  - the button is a physx collision and u have a trigger on bot your hand and the gentle man hand
	- if it overlaps the earth explode
  - add a basic game flow so that u have a start (with fade) and end screen (explosion) and a win state (earth view for longer but then u hear the click and explodes)
	- it restarts after that
  - add close detection when facing the gentle man and show a cube for now just as a placeholder
  - add the hand going down over time with a multiplier
	- the hand is always going no matter what, u can just make it go slower or faster by picking the right/wrong answer
  - hide the webxr hands when on the earth view + activate fly
